# Challenge 2: Deploy Azure Migrate Appliance

> **Duration**: 75 minutes | **Type**: Hands-on Lab | **Points**: 25

## Objective

Deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance in your ArcBox environment to discover on-premises workloads.

---

## The Business Challenge

Your assessment strategy from Challenge 1 requires actual data from the environment. Contoso Bakery needs you to:

1. Set up the Azure Migrate project
2. Deploy the discovery appliance
3. Configure credentials for all server types
4. Start discovering workloads

This is where planning meets reality — let's see what's actually running!

- [ ] You completed the Azure 101 pre-work
- [ ] You can access the Azure portal
- [ ] Your facilitator has confirmed ArcBox is deployed and ready
- [ ] You have the ArcBox VM credentials (see [ArcBox Environment](../audiences/participant/arcbox-environment.md))

   - Accept the certificate warning

2. **Set up prerequisites**:
   
   The appliance will check:
   - ✅ Internet connectivity
   - ✅ Time sync
   - ✅ Latest updates

3. **Register with Azure Migrate**:
   
   a. Paste the **project key** you saved earlier
   
   b. Click **Login**
   
   c. Click **Copy code & Login**
   
   d. In the new browser tab, paste the device code
   
   e. Sign in with your Azure credentials
   
   f. Return to the configuration manager
   
   g. Verify: **"Successfully registered"**

**Verify**:
- [ ] Appliance configuration manager accessible
- [ ] Prerequisites passed
- [ ] Appliance registered with Azure

---

### Part D: Add Discovery Credentials (15 min)

1. **Add Hyper-V Host Credentials**:

   In **Step 1: Provide Hyper-V host credentials**:
   
   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | Friendly name | `ArcBoxAdmin` |
   | Username | Administrator credentials from facilitator |
   | Password | Password from facilitator |

2. **Add Hyper-V Host**:

   In **Step 2: Provide Hyper-V host/cluster details**:
   
   - Click **Add discovery source**
   - Enter the Hyper-V host IP/FQDN (ArcBox-Client)
   - Select the `ArcBoxAdmin` credentials
   - Click **Save**
   - Wait for validation: **"Validation successful"**

3. **Add Server Credentials** (for deeper discovery):

   In **Step 3: Provide server credentials**:

   | Type | Friendly Name | Username | Purpose |
   |------|---------------|----------|---------|
   | Windows | `WindowsAdmin` | Administrator | Win2K22, Win2K25, SQL |
   | Linux | `LinuxAdmin` | arcbox | Ubuntu VMs |
   | SQL Server | `SQLAdmin` | sa (if applicable) | SQL instance discovery |

   > 💡 Get exact credentials from [ArcBox Environment](../audiences/participant/arcbox-environment.md)

**Verify**:

### Part E: Start Discovery (15 min)

1. Click **Start discovery**

2. Monitor the discovery status in the table

3. **Expected timeline**:
   - Server metadata: ~2 minutes per host
   - Full software inventory: Up to 1 hour
   - SQL discovery: Up to 24 hours (you'll see partial results)

4. **While waiting**, return to Azure portal:
   - Navigate to **Azure Migrate** → **Servers, databases and web apps**
   - Click on the discovered servers count (may take 5-10 minutes to appear)
   - You should eventually see 5 VMs:
     - ArcBox-Win2K22
     - ArcBox-Win2K25
     - ArcBox-SQL
     - ArcBox-Ubuntu-01
     - ArcBox-Ubuntu-02

**Verify**:
- [ ] Discovery started successfully
- [ ] Servers beginning to appear in Azure portal

## Success Criteria (25 Points)

| Criterion | Points | Verification |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Azure Migrate project created | 5 | Project visible in portal |
| Appliance registered | 5 | Shows "Registered" status |
| Credentials configured | 5 | Hyper-V + Windows + Linux |
| Discovery started | 5 | No errors, discovery running |
| 5 VMs discovered | 5 | All 5 ArcBox VMs visible in portal |
| **Total** | **25** | |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| VHD download slow | Check with facilitator for local copy |
| Appliance won't start | Verify enough RAM (16 GB) on Hyper-V host |
| Can't access config manager | Check network connectivity, firewall port 44368 |
| Host validation fails | Verify WinRM port 5985 is open |
| Registration fails | Ensure you have Application Developer role in Azure AD |
| Discovery stuck | Check credentials have local admin on Hyper-V host |

---

## Coaching Tips

💡 **Work in parallel** — One person downloads VHD while another creates the Migrate project

💡 **Document everything** — Save passwords and IPs, you'll need them later

💡 **Don't wait for full discovery** — Initial server discovery is fast, deeper analysis takes longer

💡 **Check the appliance logs** — If issues occur, logs are at `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure\Logs`

---

## What Just Happened?

You deployed the Azure Migrate appliance, which:

1. **Connected to your Hyper-V host** via WinRM
2. **Discovered VMs** by querying Hyper-V management interfaces
3. **Collected metadata** — VM names, OS, CPU, memory, disks
4. **Sent data to Azure** — Securely via HTTPS to your Migrate project

This is exactly how real migrations begin — with discovery!

## Next Step

⏸️ **Break for Lunch** — Discovery will continue running.

After lunch, verify your discovered servers and proceed to [Challenge 3: Assessment](03-assessment.md).
