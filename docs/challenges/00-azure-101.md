## The Business Challenge

Your team has been given access to an Azure subscription for this workshop. Before the workshop day, you need to familiarize yourself with the Azure portal and key concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this challenge, ensure:

- [ ] You have Azure subscription credentials from your facilitator
- [ ] You can sign in to the Azure portal

---

## Your Tasks

### Task 1: Navigate the Azure Portal (10 min)

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your browser
2. Sign in with the credentials provided by your facilitator
3. Explore the portal interface:
   - **Home** — Your personalized dashboard
   - **All services** — Complete service catalog
   - **Search bar** — Quick navigation (try searching "migrate")
   - **Cloud Shell** — Built-in command line

✅ **Verify**: Can you find the following?
- [ ] Your subscription name
- [ ] The resource groups in your subscription
- [ ] The Azure Migrate service

### Task 2: Understand Subscriptions & Resource Groups (10 min)

**Concepts to understand:**

| Concept | Description | Analogy |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Tenant** | Your organization's Azure AD instance | Your company |
| **Subscription** | Billing container for Azure resources | A credit card account |
| **Resource Group** | Logical container for related resources | A folder for project files |
| **Resource** | Individual Azure service instance | A file |

**Explore your subscription:**

1. Navigate to **Subscriptions** in the portal
2. Click on your workshop subscription
3. Review:
   - Subscription ID (you'll need this later)
   - Current cost/usage
   - Resource providers

**Explore resource groups:**

1. Navigate to **Resource Groups**
2. Find the pre-created ArcBox resource group
3. Click into it and explore the resources

✅ **Verify**: Answer these questions:
- [ ] What is your subscription ID? (Write it down)
- [ ] What resource group contains your ArcBox environment?
- [ ] How many resources are in that resource group?

---

### Task 3: Understand RBAC Basics (5 min)

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** determines what actions you can perform.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access, can assign roles |
| **Contributor** | Create/manage resources, can't assign roles |
| **Reader** | View only |

**Check your role:**

1. Navigate to your subscription
2. Click **Access control (IAM)**
3. Click **View my access**
4. Note your assigned role(s)

✅ **Verify**:
- [ ] What role do you have on this subscription?

---

### Task 4: Locate Azure Migrate (5 min)

Azure Migrate is the hub for migration tools. Let's find it.

1. In the portal search bar, type **"Azure Migrate"**
2. Click on **Azure Migrate** in the results
3. Explore the overview page:
   - **Servers, databases and web apps** — What we'll use today
   - **Assessment tools** — For evaluating readiness
   - **Migration tools** — For executing migrations

✅ **Verify**:
- [ ] Can you navigate to Azure Migrate?
- [ ] Do you see the "Discover, assess and migrate" section?
