## Business Context

### Current Situation

Contoso Bakery operates from a single facility with a small server room that hosts their business applications. The infrastructure is aging, and the company faces several challenges:

- **Hardware refresh due** — Servers are 6+ years old and out of warranty
- **No redundancy** — Single points of failure everywhere
- **Skills gap** — IT team stretched thin, no dedicated infrastructure specialist
- **Business continuity** — No proper disaster recovery plan
- **Growth pressure** — New B2B customers require online ordering capability

### Strategic Initiative

The Managing Director has approved a **"Cloud Migration" project** with the goal of moving all workloads to Azure within 6 months. This workshop focuses on planning and executing that migration.

## Stakeholder Requirements

### Managing Director

> "We're a small team and I need this to be simple. I can't afford for the bakery systems to go down during our busy morning rush. Just make it work reliably."

**Priorities**:
- Keep it simple
- Minimize disruption to daily operations
- Reliable systems

### Finance Manager

> "We're a small business — every euro counts. Show me that cloud makes financial sense and won't blow our budget."

**Priorities**:
- Clear, predictable costs
- Stay within budget
- Understand ongoing monthly spend

### IT Manager (also acting as CISO)

> "Our B2B customers trust us with their order data. We need to make sure we're handling it properly — I've heard about data protection regulations but we've never had a formal compliance review."

**Priorities**:
- Data protection basics
- Regulatory awareness
- Security fundamentals in Azure

### Operations Supervisor

> "I manage the bakery floor and rely on the ordering system every day. If it goes down, we can't fulfil orders. Keep it running!"

**Priorities**:
- System availability
- Simple handover
- Quick support when issues arise

## Constraints

| Constraint | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Downtime window** | Weekends only (Sat 18:00 - Sun 12:00) |
| **Timeline** | Complete migration within 3 months |
| **Budget** | €15,000 for migration (tooling, any consulting) |
| **Data sovereignty** | Some stakeholders have raised data location preferences — to be confirmed |
| **Skills** | IT team has limited Azure experience |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ All 5 servers migrated to Azure (or managed via Arc)
2. ✅ Applications functional with same or better performance
3. ✅ Data protection requirements met and documented
4. ✅ Monitoring operational with comparable visibility
5. ✅ IT team trained on Azure operations
6. ✅ Total cost of ownership reduced by 15% or justified

## Your Mission

As the migration consulting team, you will:

1. **Discover and assess** the current environment using Azure Migrate
2. **Design a migration strategy** aligned with Cloud Adoption Framework
3. **Plan migration waves** with proper sequencing and dependencies
4. **Address compliance requirements** as they emerge
5. **Optimize for cost** and design governance controls
6. **Present your plan** to Contoso Bakery leadership

## Questions to Consider

As you work through the challenges, think about:

- Which workload is the best pilot candidate?
- How do you handle the SQL database migration?
- What happens if the web server migration fails on Sunday morning?
- How will you address data protection for customer order data?
- What's your recommendation for the monitoring server?
