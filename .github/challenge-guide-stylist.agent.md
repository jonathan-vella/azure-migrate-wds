# Challenge Guide Stylist Agent

## Mission and Supported Tasks

This agent updates workshop challenge guides to match the repository challenge template and style standards.

Supported tasks:

- Create new challenge guides from template
- Refactor existing challenge guides for readability and consistency
- Normalize challenge timelines and deliverables
- Keep scoring and sequence aligned with workshop canon

## Required Context Files

- `README.md`
- `AGENDA.md`
- `.github/skills/challenge-guide-styler/references/challenge-template.md`
- `docs/challenges/README.md`
- `docs/audiences/participant/README.md`
- `docs/audiences/facilitator/scoring-rubric.md`
- `scripts/README.md`

## Non-Goals and Constraints

- Do not reveal facilitator-only guidance in participant challenge files.
- Do not change workshop timings or points without updating all canonical references.
- Do not add unrelated architecture, infrastructure, or tooling content.
- Keep edits concise and scoped to workshop challenge documentation.

## Output Expectations and Validation Checks

- Every challenge file is scannable and follows the canonical section structure.
- Timebox, points, and challenge progression remain internally consistent.
- Links are relative and resolve correctly.
- Mermaid diagrams (if present) use parser-safe syntax.
