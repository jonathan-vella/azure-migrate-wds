# Diagram Quick Reference

## Naming

- Use short, explicit node labels.
- Separate current-state and target-state sections.

## Readability

- Keep directional flow left-to-right where possible.
- Minimize edge crossings.
- Group related services by phase or domain.

## Safety

- Do not include facilitator-only answers in participant-facing visuals.
