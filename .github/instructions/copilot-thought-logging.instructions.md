# Thought Logging Policy

Thought logging is optional in this repository.

## When to Log

- Broad refactors across multiple workshop sections
- Significant scoring or script behavior changes
- Rewrites that impact both facilitator and participant experiences

## Logging Rules

- Do not create mandatory tracking files by default.
- If a log is requested, keep it concise and store it in a clearly named markdown file.
- Never log secrets, access tokens, or environment-sensitive details.
