# Documentation Standards

## Audience Separation

- Participant docs must not include facilitator-only answers, scripts, or reveal content.
- Facilitator docs may reference participant materials, but must preserve challenge intent.

## Content Requirements

- State objective, expected outcome, and timebox for challenge-oriented content.
- Keep terminology consistent with CAF Migrate and Azure Migrate workflows.
- Use actionable steps and concrete deliverables.

## Challenge Template Requirements

- New challenge guides in `docs/challenges/` must follow the canonical structure in
	`.github/skills/challenge-guide-styler/references/challenge-template.md`.
- Required sections: `Challenge Snapshot`, `Objective`, `The Business Challenge`, `Your Tasks`,
	`Expected Deliverables`, and `Success Criteria`.
- Keep challenge guides participant-friendly: concise, scannable, and task-first.

## Consistency Checks

- Keep timing, points, and sequence aligned across `README.md`, `AGENDA.md`, and challenge files.
- Ensure navigation links resolve and progression is clear from Challenge 00 to Challenge 07.
