# Documentation Standards

## Audience Separation

- Participant docs must not include facilitator-only answers, scripts, or reveal content.
- Facilitator docs may reference participant materials, but must preserve challenge intent.

## Content Requirements

- State objective, expected outcome, and timebox for challenge-oriented content.
- Keep terminology consistent with CAF Migrate and Azure Migrate workflows.
- Use actionable steps and concrete deliverables.

## Consistency Checks

- Keep timing, points, and sequence aligned across `README.md`, `AGENDA.md`, and challenge files.
- Ensure navigation links resolve and progression is clear from Challenge 00 to Challenge 07.
