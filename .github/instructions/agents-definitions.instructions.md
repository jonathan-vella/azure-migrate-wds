# Agent Definition Standards

Use these rules when this repository introduces `.agent.md` files.

## Repository Alignment

- Define agents for workshop operations only.
- Include explicit boundaries for participant-facing vs facilitator-only outputs.
- Require references to existing folders (`challenges/`, `participant/`, `facilitator/`, `scripts/`).

## Minimal Schema

Each agent definition should include:

- Mission and supported tasks
- Required context files
- Non-goals and constraints
- Output expectations and validation checks

Avoid broad platform-engineering or infrastructure-delivery assumptions.
