# Markdown Standards

- Use clear heading hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`) with no skipped levels.
- Keep lines readable and generally under 120 characters.
- Use relative links for repository files.
- Label code fences with language identifiers.
- Keep tables and checklists concise and purpose-driven.

## Workshop-Specific Rules

- Include timebox and expected deliverable in challenge-style documents.
- Flag facilitator-only sections clearly in facilitator documents.
- Avoid answer leakage into participant-facing markdown.
