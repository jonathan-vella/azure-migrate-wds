# Cost Estimate Content Standards

Use this guidance only when the workshop includes cost-estimation deliverables.

## Required Content

- Assumptions (region, sizing, runtime, licensing)
- Estimated monthly cost ranges and major cost drivers
- Optimization opportunities tied to challenge outcomes
- Risks and caveats for classroom-style estimates

## Workshop Fit

- Keep examples learner-friendly and explicitly marked as estimates.
- Avoid presenting hard guarantees or production commitments.
